# SQL Files

This directory contains SQL files that I've made to accomplish specific tasks.

- `credit-card-charges.sql` - Finds transactions that should be credit card charges but are marked as payments, and fixes the transaction type. It does **not** add the additional subrecords that are required for credit card charges.
